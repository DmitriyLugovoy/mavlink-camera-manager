# Ardupilot Camera Manager

The ArduPilot Camera Manager is an extensible cross-platform camera server for interfacing cameras with the ArduPilot platform.

It provides a RTSP service for sharing video stream and a MAVLink camera protocol compatible API to configure ground control stations (E.g: QGroundControl).
